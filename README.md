# Sales Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

This project performs data analysis on a sales dataset using Python and Pandas. It includes data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualizations to extract meaningful business insights.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze structured sales data and present basic insights through charts. It focuses on demonstrating the ability to manipulate and visualize real-world CSV datasets using Python libraries.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a CSV file (`sales.csv`) that includes fields such as:

- Date
- Product
- Sales
- Region (optional)

The dataset can be modified or replaced with any sales-related data following similar structure.

## Features

- Load and preprocess CSV data using Pandas
- Clean and explore the dataset
- Group and summarize data using `groupby()`, `sum()`, etc.
- Generate charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
  - Total sales by product (bar chart)
  - Monthly sales trends (line chart)
  - Top 5 product contributions (pie chart)
  - Regional sales comparison (if applicable)
